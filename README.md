A text viewer application that has been carefully designed around its main task: viewing and presenting [NFO files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.nfo). It comes with three different view modes (Rendered, Classic and Text Only), export functionality and lots of options!

All Windows versions starting with Windows XP are supported. iNFekt works very well with any Windows version and is available in a native 64 bit flavor.

iNFekt is a native application written in C++. It uses the Cairo open source graphics libraries. Where available, rendering uses multi-core CPUs and is accelerated by GPU hardware.
